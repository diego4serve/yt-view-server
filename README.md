# YT View Server
A small Deno web server, companion to https://github.com/diego4serve/yt-view, allowing you to view YouTube videos on your localhost. This server dynamically generates HTML containing your desired video or playlist as embedded content.

## Usage
Download the appropriate binary for your machine from the downloads page and run it. By default, the server will listen on port 3999.

Alternatively, you can run it from the source code. Clone this repository, install the Deno runtime, and execute the following command from the project's root directory.


```sh
deno task start
```
